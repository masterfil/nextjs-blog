# Welcome to My Blog!

This is a sample blog post written in MDX for a Next.js project. MDX combines the simplicity of Markdown with the power of JSX, so you can easily incorporate interactive components into your content.

## Why Use MDX?

MDX allows you to:
- Write content in Markdown.
- Embed React components for dynamic and interactive features.
- Create a seamless development experience in Next.js.

Here's an example of a simple React component in action:

{/* <ExampleComponent /> */}

## Code Example

Below is a basic JavaScript function that greets a user:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('World'));
